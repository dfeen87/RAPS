## Overview

**RAPS Flight Middleware** is a deterministic safety and predictive intelligence layer designed to operate between flight control computers (or avionics controllers) and mission-critical subsystems such as propulsion, power management, thermal control, actuation, and guidance systems.

### What It Does

The middleware transforms traditional reactive monitoring into a **proactive governed control loop**:

- 🔮 **Predict** — Forecast system behavior with uncertainty quantification
- ✅ **Validate** — Verify proposed actions against hard safety envelopes
- ⚡ **Execute** — Perform actions only when safe, with automatic fallback/rollback
- 📝 **Audit** — Maintain immutable telemetry for complete traceability

### Engineering Principles

Built on **flight-ready engineering practices**:
- ✓ Deterministic runtime behavior
- ✓ Bounded execution latency
- ✓ Multi-layer safety gating
- ✓ Built-in redundancy support
- ✓ Comprehensive rollback capabilities
- ✓ Immutable telemetry ledger

---

## Why RAPS?

Modern aerospace systems fail in the margins: small deviations accumulate across thermal stress, fatigue, timing drift, sensor noise, and coupled subsystem dynamics.

### Traditional Flight Software Limitations

- ❌ Detects problems **after** thresholds are crossed
- ❌ Lacks predictive gating at the decision layer
- ❌ Provides logs that are hard to trust or reconstruct
- ❌ Has limited rollback/failover primitives

### RAPS Solution

RAPS Flight Middleware closes this gap by introducing:

- ✅ **Predictive Digital Twin** — Forecast with confidence/uncertainty estimation
- ✅ **Deterministic Safety Monitor** — Hard limits with independent checks
- ✅ **Governance Loop** — Sense → Predict → Validate → Act → Audit
- ✅ **Rollback + Redundancy** — A/B supervisory control with failover hooks
- ✅ **Immutable Telemetry Ledger (ITL)** — Merkle anchoring for auditable traces

---

- **Thread-safe data access** with mutex protection
- **Post-flight audit integrity** verification

### 🔧 Portability & Integration

- **Platform HAL abstraction** for hardware independence
- **RTOS mutex abstractions** for real-time systems
- **Build-system agnostic** (CMake-friendly)
- **Clear seams** for SIL/HIL testing

---

## Core Concepts

### Dual-State Modeling

The middleware models the system in two coupled layers:

- **Physical State (Ψ)**: Classical metrics (voltage, current, temperature, cycles, stress, position, velocity, etc.)
- **Informational State (Φ)**: Thermal stress, structural fatigue, degradation history, drift, and resonance coherence

### Mathematical Framework

Coupling is expressed through an effective system state metric:

```
S_eff = S_nominal + λ * ΔS_stress
```

**Practical Interpretation**: S_nominal represents the standard dynamic state of the propulsion system, while dynamic stress deviations are coupled via parameter lambda to account for memory and non-linear degradation, enabling earlier detection and better predictive safety gating.

```

### 1) Predictive Digital Twin (PDT)

The PDT forecasts near-future system state under candidate commands/policies:

**Outputs:**
- Predicted end state
- Confidence & uncertainty metrics
- Predicted Early Safety Excursion (ESE) signals

**Implementations:**
- Deterministic step simulation
- Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty estimation
- Optional online residual learning hooks

### 2) Deterministic Safety Monitor (DSM)

An independent safety layer enforcing **inviolable bounds**.

**Capabilities:**
- Demand rollback (safe abort)
- Force full shutdown (catastrophic prevention)
- Restore safe-state

**Design Philosophy**: Intentionally simple, conservative, and suitable for separation on independent compute/sensor channels.

### 3) RAPS Governance Loop (Zero-Trust Execution)

A deterministic orchestrator implementing:

1. **SENSE & AUDIT** — Snapshot + commit to ITL
2. **PREDICT & PLAN** — Generate candidate policies
3. **VALIDATE** — AILEE safety gates + DSM checks
4. **EXECUTE** — Idempotent actuator transaction
5. **ROLLBACK** — If execution fails or integrity breaks
6. **AUDIT** — Immutable telemetry + Merkle anchoring

### 4) Immutable Telemetry Ledger (ITL)

A compact embedded ledger providing:

- Event commits with cryptographic hashing
- Merkle batching for efficient verification
- Root anchoring for post-flight audit integrity
- Optional downlink mirroring

### 5) REST API for Observability

A lightweight read-only HTTP/JSON API:

- **Observability-only** (GET endpoints, no control surfaces)
- **Network accessible** (binds to 0.0.0.0:8080)
- **Non-blocking** (dedicated thread, mutex-protected)
- **Real-time snapshots** of PDT, DSM, Supervisor, Rollback, ITL, and state

📖 **Documentation**: See [`docs/REST_API.md`](docs/REST_API.md) for endpoint details and [`examples/api_client/`](examples/api_client/) for Python client examples.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler** with C++17 support (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- **CMake** 3.10 or higher
- **Build Tools** (make, ninja, or platform equivalent)

### Building the Demo

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dfeen87/RAPS.git
cd RAPS

# Build the Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) test harness
cmake -S tests/sil -B build
cmake --build build

# Run tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

### Running the RTOS Demo

The RTOS demonstration (`examples/raps_demo/raps_rtos_demo.cpp`) is a reference integration example for embedded/RTOS targets. Building it requires a platform-specific toolchain; there is no standalone CMake target provided. Refer to the source file for integration guidance.

### Running the REST API Server

```bash
# Build and run the API server demo
cmake -S examples/api_client -B build/api_demo
cmake --build build/api_demo

# In one terminal, start the server
./build/api_demo/rest_api_demo

# In another terminal, access the API
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

📖 **For detailed build instructions**, see the repository documentation in `docs/`.

## Testing & Validation

RAPS is designed to be **flight-ready by construction**, not by late-stage testing. The repository includes first-class SIL and HIL infrastructure.

### Software-in-the-Loop (SIL)

**Purpose**: Deterministic, CI-friendly execution environment for the full RAPS control, prediction, and safety pipeline.

**Key Capabilities**:
- ✓ PlatformHAL SIL backend (target-agnostic stubs)
- ✓ Compile-time fault injection (actuator failures, flash errors, latency spikes)
- ✓ Deterministic execution mode (reproducible test runs)
- ✓ Coverage gates (rollback paths, failover, safety monitor responses)

**Running SIL Tests**:

```bash
cmake -S tests/sil -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

**Why It Matters**: Validates governance logic, catches race conditions and rollback bugs early, makes safety behavior auditable and repeatable.

### Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)

**Purpose**: Validate software assumptions against real hardware, timing, and actuator constraints.

**Key Capabilities**:
- ✓ HIL-backed PlatformHAL (hardware/rig-server implementation)
- ✓ Rig-driven actuator validation
- ✓ Downlink and telemetry verification
- ✓ One-shot readiness check (`examples/hil/hil_readiness_check.cpp`)

**Why It Matters**: Proves software can survive real latencies and failures, prevents "it worked in simulation" surprises.

### Unified Design Philosophy

SIL and HIL are **link-time personalities** of the same system:
- Same governance logic runs in SIL, HIL, and flight
- Safety and rollback behavior validated before certification
- Flight builds simply replace PlatformHAL backend with certified drivers

This enables seamless progression: **Research → Simulation → Hardware → Flight** without rewriting core logic.

---

## Continuous Integration

### What CI Validates

- ✓ Configures and builds the SIL test harness
- ✓ Runs fault-injection smoke tests
- ✓ Validates deterministic safety behavior

### What CI Does NOT Check

- Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) validation
- Physical testbed integration
- Network-dependent external services

### Reproducing CI Locally

```bash
cmake -S tests/sil -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
